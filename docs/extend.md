# Adding New Features

Telemetrix was designed to be user-extensible.

I've created a
[five-part blog post explaining](https://mryslab.github.io/bits-n-bots/2025/05/20/telemetrix-under-the-hood--part-1/)
Telemetrix's underpinnings.

Although the article discusses the Arduino UNO R4 Minima, the concepts are the same for all other boards.
