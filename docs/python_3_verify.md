# Verifying The Python Version

Python 3.8 or greater is required before installing and using the telemetrix-uno-r4 
package.

To check that you have the correct version of Python 3 installed,
open a command window and type:

```
python3 -V
```

For Windows, you may need to type:

```
python -V
```

Executing this command displays the current version of Python 3 installed.

```
Python 3.11.4
```

If you need to install Python 3, refer to [python.org.](https://www.python.org/)
