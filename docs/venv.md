When using Telemetrix, it is highly recommended that you work within a Python virtual 
environment.

A virtual environment isolates your project from other projects. 
Packages installed into a virtual environment are confined to your 
current project and will not affect or change packages used by other projects. 
Please refer to  [this article](https://python.land/virtual-environments/virtualenv)
or the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

If you are using the latest version of Ubuntu and Debian Linux, you are
[required](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2023/04/pip-install-error-externally-managed-environment-fix)
to use a virtual environment.
